# Password Generator
Password Generator is a command-line tool that generates secure and random passwords. The program offers four options for password generation: Default, Advanced, Custom Words, and Load Settings.

## Default
The Default option generates a password with 16 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Advanced
The Advanced option allows you to specify the number of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to include in the password. You can also remove any character types you don't want to include, and even specify the exact characters you want to include. Additionally, you can save these settings to a .txt file for future use.
